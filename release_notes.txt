1.2
===

After about a year of a rolling release (called 1.1-pre-release) we have decided
to make a "proper" release available. We encourage everybody to test this
release and report any problems. Before mid May it is envisaged to finalise this
release which will then be called 1.2.0. Furthermore we will also try to create
binary packages for various Linux distributions and it is planned to include the
1.2.0 release on the USB stick provided at the OpenFOAM workshop in Gothenburg
(22-24 June).

Version 1.2 of enGrid has a significantly improved algorithm for boundary layer
creation and an integrated surface mesher. A file template mechanism offers the
possibility to create dedicated solver output for OPENFOAM (OPENFOAM is a
registered trade mark of OpenCFD Limited) or other solvers. Currently simpleFoam
and rhoSimpleFoam are supported (versions 1.5 & 1.6). Contributions for other
solvers would be most welcome and we will certainly help anybody who wants to
extend enGrid's export capabilities.

In the future we will publish regular bug-fixes for this release and are
planning to release 1.3 towards the end of 2010. The emphasis for 1.3 will be
put on performance, robustness and documentation along with small improvements
that arise from daily engineering tasks.
